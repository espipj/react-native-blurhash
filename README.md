# React Native Blurhash
## Motivation
This repository aims to assamble a React Native Component based on the Kotlin & Swift implementation of the [Blurhash library](https://github.com/woltapp/blurhash). Implementation and usage should be similar to [react-blurhash](https://github.com/woltapp/react-blurhash) altough it cannot be ported from it as react-native-canvas performance is not enough.
